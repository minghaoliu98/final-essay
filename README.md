##THE GEOGRAPHY OF PUBLIC DOMAIN OBJECTS AT THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART is a web map project, which allows users to access a world-class collection of art and antiquities at their fingertips. This web map contains two main sections: 1) a web map to represent the artworks' location; 2) a web page that displays the artwork's information; The web map contains clustered markers that display global artworks' location.

##Since the information on the web map does not involve professional knowledge and terminologyï¼Œthe audience of this map could be anyone who in favor of the global artwork. Due to the form of web-map, the audience restricts to the user with a basic understanding of the internet and computer. The overall map design is convenient and intuitive for any user with a basic computer experience. However, the exception is one of the highest zoom levels where a user has to click a cluster to further present each marker, especially in the location with a huge group.

##This increase the difficulty of interacting with the map and could further reduce the audience into user with experience with marker cluster feature in a web map. Even though this links the location and artwork's physical location, it doesn't contain a detailed description and even the museum name. Therefore, this map cannot serve as an academic or travel advice purpose but an entertainment purpose only.
